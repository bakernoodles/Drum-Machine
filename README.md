## About the project

---

This was originally something I started around two years ago. For personal reasons I had stopped programming and left it uncomplete. I once again renewed my passion for Front-End development and decided to finish the project.

It was a light challenge because after a year, I had forgotten how I was building the app. Also, I had learned of better approaches to solve some problems. I had a lot of fun with this challenge, and I am glad I decided to finish it.
