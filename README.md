## About the project

---

This was originally something I started around two years ago. For personal reasons I had stopped programming and left it uncomplete. I once again renewed my passion for Front-End development and decided to finish the project.

It was a light challenge because after a few years, I had forgotten how I was building the app. Also, I had learned of better approaches to solve some problems. Finishing this app was a good learning experience, and I am glad I decided to finish it. It feels good to be back
