## About the project

---

Originally something I started around two years ago. For personal reasons, I had stopped programming and left the app unfinished. I am coding again, and I've always wanted to finish this app. 

I had forgotten how I coded the app, so I had to relearn my code. That part was probably the biggest challenge. I have learned a lot since starting this app till now, but if I could do this all over again, I would not overcomplicate some things in this app. For instance, the amount of nested componants. Also, I'd organize the componants more efficiently 

Completing this app was a good learning experience, I am glad I finished it. üê±‚Äçüíª
