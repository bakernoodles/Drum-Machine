## About the project

---

This was originally something I started around two years ago. For personal reasons I had stopped programming and left it unfinished. I am coding again and I've always wanted to finish this app. 

### Issues

I had forgotten how I was building the app so I had problems trying to relearn my code. Also, I had learned of better approaches to solve some problems. Finishing this app was a good learning experience, and I am glad I decided to finish it.
