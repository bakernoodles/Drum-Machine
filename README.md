## About the project

---

This was originally something I started last year. For personal reasons I had stopped programming and left it uncompleted. I once again renewed my passion for Front-End development and decided to finish the project.

It was a tad bit challenging because after a year, I had forgotten how I was building the app, or I had learned of better approaches to solve a problem. I had a lot of fun with this challenge and I am glad I decided to finish it.
